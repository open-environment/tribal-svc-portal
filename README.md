# Tribal Services Portal
The Tribal Environmental Services Portal allows Tribal agencies to organize how information is shared with stakeholders (including the public, interal tribal staff, EPA, and other tribal agencies). It serves as a hub for sharing tribal environmental data and information systems, while also providing centralized account management across multiple applications.


## Browser tests
We use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) to automate testing of the Tribal Services Portal in different available browsers. We want to provide the same experience to all people that use the Tribal Services Portal.
